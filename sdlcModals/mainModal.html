        The Waterfall methodology is one of the oldest surviving SDLC methodologies. It follows a straightforward approach: the project development team completes one phase at a time, and each phase uses information from the last one to move forward.
<br>
While this methodology does make the needs and outcomes clear, and gives each stage of the model a well-defined starting and ending point, there are downsides in Waterfall’s rigidity. In fact, some experts believe the Waterfall model was never meant to be a working SDLC methodology for developing software because of how fixed it is in nature. Because of this, SDLC Waterfall methods are best used for extremely predictable projects.

        <p>The Iterative model is all about repetition. Instead of starting out with a comprehensive overview of the requirements, development teams build the software piece by piece and identify further requirements as they go along. As a result, each new phase in the Iterative model produces a newer, more-refined version of the software under development.

            Iterative allows developers and testers to identify functional or design flaws early, and can easily adapt to the ever-changing needs of the client. Like Spiral, Iterative suits larger projects and requires more management and oversight to work well.</p>

        <p>Prototype is a working model of software with some limited functionality. The prototype does not always hold the exact logic used in the actual software application and is an extra effort to be considered under effort estimation.</p>
        <br>
        Software prototyping is used in typical cases and the decision should be taken very carefully so that the efforts spent in building the prototype add considerable value to the final software developed. The model has its own pros and cons discussed as follows.
        <br>
        The advantages of the Prototyping Model are as follows −
        <br>
            Increased user involvement in the product even before its implementation.
        <br>
            Since a working model of the system is displayed, the users get a better understanding of the system being developed.
        <br>
            Reduces time and cost as the defects can be detected much earlier.
        <br>
            Quicker user feedback is available leading to better solutions.
        <br>
            Missing functionality can be identified easily.
        <br>
            Confusing or difficult functions can be identified.
        <br>
        The Disadvantages of the Prototyping Model are as follows −
        <br>
            Risk of insufficient requirement analysis owing to too much dependency on the prototype.
        <br>
            Users may get confused in the prototypes and actual systems.
        <br>
            Practically, this methodology may increase the complexity of the system as scope of the system may expand beyond original plans.
        <br>
            Developers may try to reuse the existing prototypes to build the actual system, even when it is not technically feasible.
        <br>
            The effort invested in building prototypes may be too much if it is not monitored properly.

        <p>Agile is a combination of an incremental and iterative approach, where the product is released on an ongoing cycle then tested and improved at each iteration. Fast failure is encouraged in agile methodology: the theory is that if you fail fast and early, you can solve minor issues before they grow into major issues.

            Agile is one of the most common methodologies out there today but it’s technically more of a framework than a distinct model. Within Agile, there are sub-models in place such as extreme programming (XP), Rapid Application Development (RAD), Kanban and Scrum methodology.</p>

     <p>The spiral model has four phases. A software project repeatedly passes through these phases in iterations called Spirals.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This phase starts with gathering the business requirements in the baseline spiral. In the subsequent spirals as the product matures, identification of system requirements, subsystem requirements and unit requirements are all done in this phase.

        This phase also includes understanding the system requirements by continuous communication between the customer and the system analyst. At the end of the spiral, the product is deployed in the identified market.</p>

       <p>The V-model is a type of SDLC model where process executes in a sequential manner in V-shape. It is also known as Verification and Validation model. It is based on the association of a testing phase for each corresponding development stage. <br> Development of each step directly associated with the testing phase. The next phase starts only after completion of the previous phase i.e. for each development activity, there is a testing activity corresponding to it.      </p>
